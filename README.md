1. What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?
The most challenging part was getting ARIA roles and attributes right. While theyâ€™re really useful for improving accessibility, it was hard to know when to use them and how to avoid making things confusing. I had to research how screen readers work with ARIA roles and practice using them alongside semantic HTML.

2. How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?
ARIA attributes provide extra help for screen readers and other tools to understand the page. For example, aria-live makes sure that updates are read out loud right away, & aria-describedby connects extra information or error messages to form fields. This makes websites easier for everyone to use

3. What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?
I used the Web AIM Contrast Checker to check the contrast between text and background colors. It helped make sure the text was readable by meeting the required contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for larger text). It showed me whether the colors passed or failed, which was useful for making the site more accessible.
